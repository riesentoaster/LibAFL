# Differential Fuzzing on Coreutils
## Requirements:
- A [rust toolchain](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- `cargo-make`: `cargo install cargo-make`

Then, you can either go through the steps outlined in [Makefile.toml](./Makefile.toml), or just run `cargo make run` to build everything and start the fuzzer.
